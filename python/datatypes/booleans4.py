# now we will look at another operator like and and or, not

# not simply negates a boolean

# if the boolean is True, "notting" the boolean makes it False, and vice versa

# try to guess the outcome of these print statements

print(not False)
print(not True)
print(not not True)

# more exercises

print(not (False and False))
print(not (True or True))
print(not True and not False)
