# functions

# say we want to print out a few things

print("my name is aiden")
print("i am 25 years old")
print("i live in buenos aires")

# now say for some reason we want to print the same thing again

print("my name is aiden")
print("i am 25 years old")
print("i live in buenos aires")

# now say we want to print it out a third time...

# ok this is getting a big tiring, there must be a better way...

# enter function...

# we will create a function in python to execute this code

def sayBio():    
    print("my name is aiden")
    print("i am 25 years old")
    print("i live in buenos aires")

# dont forget the indentation

# and now we can just call this function

print("printing bio twice")

sayBio();
sayBio();

# exercise 1
